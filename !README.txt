Project EUROPA is a mod for HOI4 that intends to replicate the EU4 experience.

This mod has been in development since September 2017.

As this mod is still in development, it is not currently on the Steam Workshop.

DISCLAIMER:

This mod is owned by me, TrumpyGoad, and I reserve the right to publish it on the Steam Workshop when it is ready.

If you do try and steal this mod or its contents, I will pursue legal action for intellectual property.


-----HOW TO INSTALL THE MOD:-----

Move all the folders except the Project_Europa.mod file to a new folder named Project_EUROPA under the directory of: documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod/FOLDER GOES HERE!!!

End result should look something like this:
.../documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod/Project_EUROPA

Move the .mod file under the same directory, OUTSIDE the newly created folder.


The mod should then appear as "!Project Europa" in the HOI4 launcher.
